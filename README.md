### Favorite movie
My favorite movie as of now would be called the ==Everything Everywhere All at Once==
It is a funny drama movie that will leave you questioning your whole exixtense :joy:
Its about an asian mother who owns a laundry shop that questions her life is this life is what she really wanted; to be stuck her whole life buried in doing taxes. It made me relate to bo0th the mother and the daughter due to their beliefs and differences. Especially when the daughter came out as someone who likes women. 
Here is a trailer of the movie in case you are interested in watching too.
